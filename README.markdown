# Cooking some codes

To summarise this repository, this is a collection of the codes I wrote to solve some of the easier problems on codechef. 

Problem solving was never really a hobby of mine. Working with software development over the past few years has given the opportunity of observing the capacity of problem solving skills in critical situations. As an ode to that joy of jumping in to a messy situation and coding the solutions away, the excitement of that "Yes! Solved it!!" feeling, I decided to give problems solving a go.

The codes here are not the most beautiful or elegant ones. Most of the time they focus more on passing the tests. This repository is not meant to be viewed as a polished documentation of programming skill. This is more of a scrapbook where I have written stuff when I felt like it.
